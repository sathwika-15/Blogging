                <p> Starting My Blogging Journey & Solving a LeetCode Problem<br>
                    Hello and welcome to my blog! ðŸŽ‰ Today marks the beginning of my blogging adventure. 
                    Iâ€™ve just finished setting up this website and I'm excited to share my journey with you. 
                    To kick things off, I tackled a problem from LeetCode titled "Length of Last Word," which is categorized as an easy-level challenge.<br>
                    Problem Overview:The goal of this problem is to find the length of the last word in a given string. Words are separated by spaces, and trailing spaces should be ignored.
                    Solution Approach:In this problem, we mainly deal with string and array manipulation.Here's how I solved it using Java<br>
                    The split(" ") method breaks the string into an array of words wherever there is a space. This handles multiple spaces and ensures we get a clean list of words.<br>
                    The last word is accessed using arr[arr.length - 1]. This is because arrays are zero-indexed, so the last element is at index arr.length - 1.<br>
                    Finally, arr[arr.length - 1].length() gives us the length of the last word.<br>
                    That wraps up my first day of learning and blogging. I hope you found this breakdown helpful! Stay tuned for more updates as I continue exploring coding problems and sharing my experiences. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to mail me.
